# AStarPathfinding
This project implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a grid, considering obstacles. User can specifiy the heuristic costs between two points using different methods: Manhattan, Euclidean, and Octagonal distance and whether the pathfinding should be diagonal or not.
